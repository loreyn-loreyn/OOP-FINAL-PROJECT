However, little research has investigated inequalities in exposure to compound drought-heatwaves under climate change. Here, we reveal a significant disparity between low-income and high-income regions in terms of global compound drought-heatwave occurrence using observations and climate models. We find that low-income regions experienced a 377% [351 - 403%] increase in the frequency of compound drought-heatwaves from 1981 to 2020, which is twice as fast as the increase observed in high-income regions (184% [153 - 204%]). This inequality is largely attributed to a similar disparity in drought occurrence rather than heatwave occurrence. Climate change attribution suggests that anthropogenic warming has doubled the frequency of compound drought-heatwaves over 31% [14 - 50%] of low-income regions, compared to only 4.7% [0.9 - 8.3%] of high-income regions. The frequency of compound drought-heatwaves would not have increased in low-income regions without anthropogenic climate change but would still have risen in high-income regions.",

In addition to altering the climate, dirty energy also comes with unacceptable ecological and human health impacts.\n\n\tWe must replace coal, oil, and gas with renewable and efficient energy sources. Thankfully, with each passing year, clean energy is making gains as technology improves and production costs go down. But according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5Â°C, in order to meet the goal of reducing global carbon emissions by at least 45 percent below 2010 levels before 2030 - which scientists tell us we must do if we're to avoid the worst, deadliest impacts of climate change - we must act faster.\n\n\tThere are promising signs. Wind and solar continue to account for ever-larger shares of electricity generation. In 2021, wind and solar generated a record 10 percent of electricity worldwide. And modeling by NRDC has found that wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear could account for as much as 80 percent of U.S. electricity by the end of this decade.

Governments around the world aren't just anticipating an all-electric future; they're bringing it into fruition by setting goals and binding requirements to phase out the sale of gas-powered internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. That year, 2035, is expected to mark a turning point in the adoption of EVs and in the fight against climate change as countries around the world - as well as numerous automakers - have announced goals to phase out gas-powered cars and light trucks. This shift will also benefit our grid: EVs are like a âbattery on wheelsâ and have the potential to supply electricity back to the network when demand peaks, helping to prevent blackouts.\n\n\tIt's also critical that we consider all of the different ways we get around and build sustainability into each of them. By increasing access to public transportation - such as buses, ride-sharing services, subways, and streetcars - as well as embracing congestion pricing, we can cut down on car trips and keep millions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere every year. And by encouraging zero-emission forms of transportation, such as walking and biking, we can reduce emissions even more. Boosting these alternate forms of transportation will require more than just talk. They require funding, planning, and the building out of supportive infrastructure by leaders across the local, state, and national levels.\n\n\tTo address the full set of impacts of the transportation sector, we need holistic and community-led solutions around things like land-use policies and the way we move consumer goods.

That's why it's all the more important that we raise public awareness of cost- and carbon-saving changes that individuals can make in their homes and workplaces, and make it easier for people to purchase and install energy-efficient technology, such as heat pumps (which can both heat and cool spaces) and certified appliances through programs like Energy Star in the United States or EnerGuide in Canada.\n\n\tBeyond the measures that can be taken by individuals, we need to see a dedication from private businesses and governments to further building decarbonization, which simply means making buildings more efficient and replacing fossil fuel - burning systems and appliances with clean-powered ones. Policy tools can help get us there, including city and state mandates that all newly constructed homes, offices, and other buildings be outfitted with efficient all-electric systems for heating, cooling, and hot water; requirements that municipalities and states meet the latest and most stringent energy conservation standards when adopting or updating their building codes would also be impactful.

By 2030, at least one in seven U.S. homes is projected to have rooftop solar panels, which emit no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, and which generate electricity year-round (in hot or cold weather) so long as the sun is shining. Solar energy currently accounts for just under 3 percent of the electricity generated in the United States - enough to power 18 million homes - but is growing at a faster rate than any other source. By 2035, it could account for as much as 40 percent of electricity generation. From 2020 through 2026, solar will account for more than half of new electricity generation worldwide.\n\n\tWhat to do when the sun doesn't shine, you might ask. Alongside the boom in solar has been a surge in companion battery storage: More than 93 percent of U.S. battery capacity added in 2021 was paired with solar power plants. Battery storage is key to the clean energy revolution - and adapting to a warming world. Not only are batteries important at night when the sun isn't out, but on hot days when homes draw a lot of electricity to power air conditioners, battery storage can help manage the energy demand and control the threat of power failures."));

Currently, wind accounts for just above 9 percent of U.S. electricity generation, but it, like solar, is growing fast as more states and utilities come to recognize its ability to produce 100 percent clean energy at a remarkably low cost. Unsurprisingly, states with plenty of wide-open space - including Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas - have huge capacity when it comes to wind power, but many analysts believe that some of the greatest potential for wind energy exists just off our coasts. Offshore wind even tends to ramp up in the evenings when home electricity use jumps, and it can produce energy during the rainy and cloudy times when solar energy is less available. Smart planning and protective measures, meanwhile, can ensure we harness the massive promise of offshore wind while limiting or eliminating potential impacts on wildlife."));

For instance, geothermal energy works by drilling deep underground and pumping extremely hot water up to the earth's surface, where it is then converted to steam that, once pressurized, spins a generator to create electricity. Hydroelectric energy uses gravity to âpullâ water downward through a pipe at high speeds and pressures; the force of this moving water is used to spin a generator's rotor.\n\n\tHumans have been harnessing heat energy from below the earth's surface for eons - just think of the hot springs that provided warmth for the people of ancient Rome. Today's geothermal plants are considered clean and renewable so long as the water and steam they bring up to the surface is redeposited underground after use. Proper siting of geothermal projects is also important, as recent science has linked some innovative approaches to geothermal to an increased risk of earthquakes.\n\n\tHydroelectric plants, when small-scale and carefully managed, represent a safe and renewable source of energy.

By March 2019, it had mobilised over a million participants in 2,200 events across 125 countries, demonstrating its vast reach and influence.\n\n\t'Fridays for Future' transcends being merely a protest; it represents a crucial global call to action fuelled by the youth, exemplifying the power of the internet to unite and mobilise young people worldwide. Backed by a broad coalition of parents, scientists, and activists, this movement advocates for transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy, showcasing the transformative impact of youth-led activism in shaping a sustainable future."));

The event began as a grassroots effort to raise awareness about climate change and energy conservation by having participants turn off their lights for one hour. \n\n\tDuring its first year, the initiative led to a notable 10.2% reduction in Sydney's energy use, with around 2.2 million people taking part. Its success quickly garnered global attention, and by the following year, famous landmarks like Rome's Colosseum and Venice's city hall had joined the movement.\n\n\tThe primary goal of 'Earth Hour' is to highlight the importance of climate action through this symbolic act. Participants turning off their lights from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time contribute to reducing carbon emissions and light pollution whilst advocating for more sustainable energy practices.

This app was created to help people learn what they need to learn about climate change and if ever that they have trouble remembering or understanding what it is, the app was additionally given features such as giving challenges or tasks that could help remind as well as teach the users things related to climate change.");
