# OOP-FINAL-PROJECT

I. A brief project overview 

    Your Cli-Mate Learning Application is an application designed to provide compiled and organized information regarding climate change to promote awareness to the users who would use the application. This application was created with the intention to give a detailed and compiled information about what climate change is, in order to promote awareness as well as help with the SDG's 13th goal about taking action against climate change. This is not only the reason for the creation of this application as this app was intended to also help spread and give knowledge and learnings as well as insights to encourage everyone to help with the fight against climate change such as sharing the reasons why one should take action against climate change and the ways we could help to reduce the impact of the climate change as individuals residing here on Earth and as people who have a fair share of responsibility for what the Earth have become as of now. Because of our continuous use of resources such as fossils and oils as well as our continuous burning of plastic wastes, use of chemicals, cutting of trees, use of transportation operated by non-renewable energy, we slowly contribute to the impact and worsening of the climate change state on our Earth. This app was created to help people learn what they need to learn about climate change and if ever that they have trouble remembering or understanding what it is, the app was additionally given features such as giving challenges or tasks that could help remind as well as teach the users things related to climate change.

II. Explanation of how OOP principles were applied

    Object Oriented Pogramming or OOP have four principles, these are the inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism. Now I will explain how these principles were applied in my project in a very short and concise manner. First of all, the encapsulation. The encapsulation in my project was applied to impose restriction on the accessibility of the objects data present in my program as well as to make my code more organize by placing each method in different constructor base on their function and category as well as easily pinpoint the cause of possible error in my program. Additionally, the principle was also applied to prevent method duplication, as with the constructor, I could use the method saved in the contructor in different classes without any need to re-write it in each class.
    
    Now, moving on to the next principle; the inheritance. The principle of inheritance in my project was applied to inherit the method as well as objects from the parent class to the child class. This is so that the code (method or object) duplication, just like in encapsulation, would be prevented and the re-using of the methods or objects in the parent class could be possible, making the program or code more easily to navigate to, organize and easy to understand. In addition to this, the application of this principle also makes it possible for me to make certain modifications to the program through the use of override which allows the child class to temporarily dominate and modify the outcome or method of the method or object being inherited from the parent class. 

    The principle of abstraction on the otherhand was applied in the project to abstract certain methods (like hiding the complex lines of a method making it possible for only the necessary information to be shown in the program), provide a common structure for each related classes, ensure their consistent behavior as well as promote code reusability (just like that of other principles). In my project, I used the abstract principle of OOP to mainly organize the method of the functions that would be used in my program as well as to make it possible for the methods inside of the abstract class to be accesses by other classes while omitting the unecessary lines of statements, behaviors or information.

    The last principle, the polymorphism was applied through inheritance and overriding, in where multiple child classes are able to override certain methods from the parent class to provide its own implementation as well as temporarily become treated as a part or an object of the parent class while maintaining the same behavior of the code, making the code more flexible, reusable and easier to maintain. Also, the principle of polymorphism was also applied in my project through the use of the cases of collections, the ArrayList, which was used to store information in the array to be then passed and used on other classes in my program.

III. Details of the chosen SDG and its integration into the project

    My chosen Sustaible Development Goal revolves around Climate Actions, and Climate Change Effects. Additionally, it is the 13th goal of SDG of the United Nations Organization. The integration of the said SDG goal to the project could be seen by how the project was constructed mainly to promote awareness and learnings about climate change, this is to promote and encourage the users who would use the app to take action against climate change. As a way to show and provide proof about the integration of my chosen SDG in my project, different features are applied to spread awareness about the climate change such as sharing compiled information about what is need to be known in climate change as easily as selecting or inputing the number of choice from the provided menu as well as solutions which one could do to help lessen the effect or impact of the climate change. Futhermore, important reasons  and intriguing challenges were also included in the application which could help encourage people to take action. All in all, the integration of the SDG goal 13 could be seen on how the project tries to help and act in-line with the objectives of SDG 13 by trying to promote action against climate change through awareness and encouragement;


IV. Instructions for running the program

    Here are the instructions that you must do to run the program:
    (NOTE: It is highly recommended to do this in a computer or pc. But if you are using a phone, then at least, when in the website, turn on the desktop site function of your browser.)

    Step 1: Create or Open Your GitHub account

            Search "Github" in your browser and create your GitHub account (if you don't have one) by signing up in the website before moving to the next, on the other hand, if you already have an existing account, then you just need to login in you account and do the next step.

    Step 2: Searching for the Program's Repository

            After creating or logging-in in your GitHub account, click the search bar of the GitHub website located in the same line as that of the word "Dashboard" just below the browser's search bar. When you finished clicking the searching bar, copy and paste this part inside the double quotation then "repo:loreyn-loreyn/OOP-FINAL-PROJECT".
    
    Step 3: Accessing Program

            When you finish the 2nd step, you would then be able to see the Java files(*.java) and README.md file that were saved in the repository. But instead of clicking the files in the repository, what you would click is the green-colored "Code" button in the site, after clicking the button, find the Codespaces tab just below the button or beside the local tab and then click it.
            
            You will then see the "+" sign beside the triple-dot sign which is in the same line as the word Codespaces. Click it so that you will be redirected to the codespace in where you would see all of the files saved in the repository. There would then be a pop-up or notification on the right-lower part of your device which you need to install to run the program. It asks the question "Do you want to install the recommended 'Extension Pack for Java' extension from Microsoft for the Java language?".

    Step 4: Running the Program

            The successful installation of the extension guarantees that the program could then be run and compiled without a problem regarding the compiler. What you now need to do is to click the file icon (just on top of the search icon on the left part of the website) and click the Main.java file. After clicking the Main.java file, find the play button on the right upper part of the screen and click it to run the program. (You could also run the program by clicking the "Run" word which is a button just on top of "public static void Main(String[] args) function.)
